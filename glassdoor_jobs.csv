You jumped right in. After a period of acclimation with your new teammates, you started work on an existing data analytics project, helping the team complete key objectives on time.
You’ve had a role in several other projects building ETL processes and expanding data warehouse capabilities. This has allowed you to build connections across the Resource Data offices.

You’ve identified datasets that look intriguing. You’re comfortable working directly with the client and have started discussing how they might use them for better insights.
Three months in and you’re a bona fide member of the Resource Data team. The client sees Resource Data as their data analytics experts.
At six months you’re developing opportunities.
You’ve started working with the client on a new initiative. You’re leading the research and developing a proof-of-concept to validate the idea and turn it into a full project.

You’ve led an internal discussion about common tools used in data analytics and the problem sets they are applied to. This has led to requests from other branches to support developing data analytics practice areas.
After one year, you’re building Resource Data and have a vision of a data analytics team.
You’ve identified several other clients in the local area in need of data analytics services. You have worked with the proposal team to develop technical estimates and present proposals. New clients are coming on board.

1st Modification: Education:
Expand candidate pool to include candidates with AAS degrees in either Electrical Technology or Electrical Power Technology
2nd Modification: Key Tasks, Add the following bulleted items to more accurately detail what would be expected of a contractor performing work on either the NY / NE Data Enhancement Project:
Contractor will compare on a Feeder by Feeder basis (i) the vendor photo and the assets identified within the photo to (ii) the assets identified with the NG Smallworld GIS system and (iii) the assets located on the NG regional control center index maps. The contractor will identify any discrepancies between these three components and either (a) update the NG Smallworld GIS system where appropriate or (b) recommend changes to the NG Smallworld GIS and Index Maps for correction by other NG departments. All updates, recommended changes or questions to external groups shall be entered by the Contractor within the NG IMAP ARCGIS Online environment. Contractor will confirm the photo quality and verify that the photo assigned to a NG GIS Asset ID is consistent with the asset information within NG Smallworld GIS. Discrepancies will require that the Outside Vendor for Photo Acquisition be notified to enable them to correct the photos.
Contractor execute a series of checks which validate the connectivity of the feeder. Contractor will update the NG Smallworld GIS system as appropriate to correct any validation errors.
Contractor (separate from the contractor who performs the virtual walk down and validation phases) will perform a quality control / quality assurance step on the feeder, ensuring that the proposed modifications are accurate based on the QAQC Status assigned to the Virtual Walk Down person. Corrections to the feeder will be sent back to the person assigned the Virtual Walk Down / Validation steps for corrections. Contractor will prepare and send to the NG Maps & Records Sharepoint site (i) all Index Map changes and (ii) complex changes.
QAQC Contractor resource will close out a feeder by posting the Smallworld GIS modifications within the NG Smallworld GIS system when a feeder has been determined to be clean of any issues / discrepancies. The QAQC Contractor will notify the National Grid DP&I department that a feeder is closed, enabling the DP&I department to continuously monitor that feeder for any modifications in the future.
Manager notes:
- Project's original scope is through March 2021.
- Location: Syracuse NY
- Open to candidates who need to relocate (please indicate this at the top of the resume).
There should not be any additional charge to National Grid for the candidate to relocate.
- Electric distribution experience/knowledge is requested, but not required.
- GIS experience - not a necessity but it does help with the process of using the tools
- When the contractor is reviewing the asset on the poles and comparing it's very helpful
to have knowledge of electrical distribution
-BA degree or equivalent experience
-MA degree is overqualified
- Independent worker is valuable
*More electric distribution experience requested as compared to ARCGIS experience. We can teach the ARCGIS experience, but the electric experience is valuable when a virtual walk down of the electricity distribution system occurs to confirm the connectivity model. The connectivity model is a simple way of indicating that all of the components on the electric distribution system align.*

About Scratch:
Scratch's mission is to build a repayment platform to change the way consumers experience debt. Most of us take on debt to help us get ahead, or in many cases, to not fall behind. But for most of us—despite its necessity—once we have debt, it doesn't play a healthy role in our lives. It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Google, Dropbox, Amazon, Pinterest, Facebook and Affirm. Our office is based in San Francisco.

With a growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans.

Over the past decade, Success Academies has grown faster than any charter network in the nation, building a vibrant network of 47 elementary, middle and high schools. Our ~16,000 children mostly poor and minority are out-performing students at top city and suburban schools across New York State. Our goals for our second decade are even more ambitious: to grow to 100 schools and to educate 50,000 children across New York City in a uniquely holistic pre-k-12 system, bringing transformational change here and across the country.

But in today's new era, it's all about relationships.

About Go
We're building the world’s first Social Life platform; it’s called Go. Use it to plan some binge-watching of a Netflix series with a buddy, have a potluck with your close friends, plan a great night out with a date, see a concert, make it on time for the best happy hour you never knew about with old friends, or find and enroll in a nearby yoga (or boxing, or rock climbing…) class that fits perfectly in your schedule. If you’re feeling adventurous, check out a list of the best stuff happening in your city that you love or are visiting, or explore new activities that you’ve always wanted to experience but don’t know where to start (and don’t have time and motivation to research it all on the internet).
All of that ‘stuff’, well, it’s what makes our worlds go-round; because that’s what life is about. Friends. Family. Community. Love. Adventure. So, instead of staring down at a smartphone at all hours of the day opining on things that your community has already done. Go creates a world where every post on your feed is something you can actually go and do. A platform that helps you plan and coordinate and get out there. Off the screen and into the fray of real life. That’s Go.
We’re not gonna lie: Go is early-stage. But we’re funded, led by an incredible, passionate, and prestigious team, and have a product that very well may make the world a better place. We’re not Uber for cats, or some weird new drink or delivery service. We’re attempting to solve the monumental problem of social rift. We believe that a path back from a post-fact, post-community world is one that starts with a cup of coffee with an old friend. Or a bike ride. Any time you’re off you’re social media feeds and hanging out with others. A technology company devoted to making life better through empowering people to build and enrich real-life relationships with friends, family, and community.
Go is founded on the belief that a healthy social life is fundamentally made up of two things: spending time with people and doing the things that you want to do. It’s that simple: People should do what they love and be free to live the best life possible. Social technology should help us in real life by promoting human agency and self-actualization, and must stand against exploitation and the monetisation of its users and their personal data. Our world and environment has untapped and unknown richness, beauty and potential. Happiness is contagious whether found through extraordinary events or shared simple and mundane experiences. Tech can help happiness grow and make life better - in the real world.

4.0",-1,1999,-1,Advertising & Marketing,"JOB OVERVIEW
Love Communications is seeking an energetic Data Analyst with a passion for data-driven storytelling. The Data Analyst will be expected to craft reports, create and maintain dashboards, give presentations to clientele/internal stakeholders alike, and communicate with individuals from all walks of life on the performance of marketing campaigns and broader data trends. As such, this individual must possess a blend of technical skills in the realm of data analytics (data visualization, knowledge of statistical analysis techniques, exposure to marketing analytics, et cetera), as well as soft skills in the ability to work with individuals in a respectful and efficient manner, give presentations on data findings, respond to feedback, and ultimately work well in a team-first environment. Technical proficiency with Tableau (or an equivalent BI tool) is required, and individuals comfortable with marketing analytics tools (Google Campaign Manager, Google Analytics, Google Ads, Search Ads 360, Facebook Ads Manager, SEMrush, et cetera) will be preferred, but this is not explicitly required.
ESSENTIAL DUTIES
The Data Analyst will be directly responsible for a suite of clientele and managing their analytics needs. This includes, but is not limited to, the following duties:
· Report Generation: The data analyst – in conjunction with the lead media buyers and account personnel – is responsible for crafting reports on campaign performance on a designated cadence by using primary marketing data sources, as well as secondary areas of intelligence to tell effective data stories. This necessitates a sharp eye to reduce errors in said reports, strong task and time-management skills, and most importantly, the ability to see beyond the numbers and procure recommendations/insights based on what is occurring within the data.
· Dashboard Creation: Through Tableau the data analyst will be responsible for crafting, maintaining, and regularly expanding upon live dashboards that the client(s) will have access to. This requires a blend of technical skills to utilize BI software, but also a flare for visual design and creativity to push these dashboards to be as innovative as possible. This will also include blending secondary and tertiary data sources – that are often not marketing related – to enhance the overall appeal, usefulness, and storytelling capabilities of these dashboards.

"Success Academy Charter Schools
2.7",-1,2006,-1,K-12 Education,"Position Description: Data Analyst

The mission of Success Academies is to reimagine public education. From the classroom to the halls of government, this means finding profoundly different approaches to how we structure, implement and support schooling. We reconceive every aspect of school design, from writing rigorous new curricula to drawing regularly on the advances in technology and business that are transforming every sector except education.

Over the past decade, Success Academies has grown faster than any charter network in the nation, building a vibrant network of 47 elementary, middle and high schools. Our ~16,000 children mostly poor and minority are out-performing students at top city and suburban schools across New York State. Our goals for our second decade are even more ambitious: to grow to 100 schools and to educate 50,000 children across New York City in a uniquely holistic pre-k-12 system, bringing transformational change here and across the country. At 100 schools, we will graduate 3,000 scholars each year who are prepared to enter, persist and graduate from college and eventually to lead in business, government and civic realms.

To further position the organization for this rapid growth, Success Academies must reimagine the way work is done across both the enterprise and our network of schools -- valorizing simplification, efficiency and effectiveness. To help the organization make these necessary shifts and radically improve enterprise-wide performance, Success Academies established the Success Edge Office to promote and facilitate the implementation of proven continuous improvement methods and tools, and thereby root out inefficiencies and wasteful work. Data & Analytics capability is needed to put in place a baseline of actionable management reporting that adheres to high reporting standards, generates standard and ad-hoc reporting, and performs meaningful analytics.

The Data Analyst reports to the Leader of Success Edge.


In this role, you will:
Monitor relevant Key Performance Indicators to track and measure outcomes and impact;
Apply the standard enterprise continuous improvement methodology to daily work;
Apply effective project and change management processes to drive radical improvements;
Monitor and manage metrics and reporting for EDGE Office, including daily, weekly and monthly reporting, data summaries, and trend analysis; and
Produce actionable data insights for our enterprise in the form of interactive dashboards and visualizations, ad hoc reports and analysis.
Continuously partner with Network and School-based staff to understand school and business data needs and translate those requirements into high-quality work.
The Data Analyst must work closely with a broad base of constituencies across Success Academies and will be expected to exhibit...
Teamwork and collaboration;
Strong communication skills with the ability to effectively communicate in both written and verbal forms;
Results orientation;
